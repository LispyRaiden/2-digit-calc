The overall purpose of the program “2 digit calculator” is to make small number calculating fast instead of using a calculator and typing it all out. 
Unfortunately the calculator cannot take in decimals but it can give you an answer that has a decimal. 
The program works in steps. 
The first number is either an addend, minuend, factor, dividend, or a base. 
The second number is either an addend, subtrahend, factor, divisor, or exponent. 
The final input is the action that will be used. When you run the program, it will prompt you for a start command. 
Once done, the calculator will ask you questions about the numbers you want to use. 
They'll be inputs,(x = int(input()) and y = int(input()). The program will then ask for the method you want. 
The program checks to see which action you chose. “if z in multiply_action:” is an example. 
Once the action has been identified, the data goes into the formula. 
Then you got your answer.
